# SingleCellAtlas_Sjap

Code for "Dynamic single-cell transcriptomics reveals lsamp-guided neural network formation in male S. japonicum driving female reproduction".

Codes in Rmd or Jupyter Notebook format can be used to replicate figures and analysis results in the paper.

Utility functions are available in the `./SingleCellAtlas_Sjap/R` directory.

## Project Structure

### Rmd files:

- `Fig1_S1-S5.Rmd`
- `Fig2_S6-S9.Rmd`
- `Fig3_S10-S13.Rmd`

These R Markdown files reproduce the main and supplementary figures in the paper.

### Jupyter Notebooks (`SingleCellAtlas_Sjap/jupyter/`):

- `Fig2B.ipynb`
- `FigS10CDE-S11CDE.ipynb`

These notebooks provide additional figure generation and analysis.

### Utility R Scripts (`SingleCellAtlas_Sjap/R/`):

- `plotFunctions.R`: Contains plotting utility functions.
- `Velocity.R`: Contains functions related to RNA velocity analysis.

## Usage

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the relevant `.Rmd` files in RStudio or the `.ipynb` notebooks in JupyterLab.
3.  Run the code to reproduce the figures and analyses as described in the paper.

## Requirements

- R and RStudio (for `.Rmd` files)
- Python and Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)
